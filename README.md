# Restaurant Tips Prediction using Excel

## Description

In this project, we use **Excel** to predict **restaurant tips** based on various customer and dining attributes.

### Dataset Overview

The dataset, **Restaurant Tips Dataset.xlsx**, contains tips data for different customers. Below are the features included in the dataset:

| Feature      | Description                                           |
|--------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| **sex**      | Gender of the customer (Male/Female)                   |
| **smoker**   | Indicates if the customer is a smoker (Yes/No)        |
| **day**      | Day of the restaurant visit                           |
| **time**     | Time of the meal (Lunch/Dinner)                       |
| **size**     | Number of people dining together                      |
| **total_bill**| Total bill amount in USD                             |
| **tip**      | Tip amount in USD                                     |

### Project Tasks

The following tasks are performed in this project using **Excel**:

1. **Data Preparation**:
   - Use the **Restaurant Tips Dataset** for analysis.
   - Check and clean the data for any missing values.

2. **Feature Identification**:
   - Identify the independent and dependent features in the dataset.
   
3. **Problem Definition**:
   - Define the type of predictive problem: We aim to predict the tip amount based on the other features.

4. **Data Encoding**:
   - Encode categorical variables (e.g., gender, smoker status) to numeric values using **IF conditions** in Excel.

5. **Model Building**:
   - Build an appropriate regression model using the dataset.
   - Calculate both **predicted** and **actual** tip values.

6. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Calculate the **RMSE** (Root Mean Square Error) to evaluate the model's performance.
     - **RMSE** = The square root of the mean of the squared errors.

### Tools Required

- **Microsoft Excel**
- **Data Analysis Add-in** (for regression analysis and statistical tools)

### Expected Deliverables

- A **model** to predict restaurant tips based on input values.
- The **mathematical equation** derived from the regression model to predict the tip amount.
- The **RMSE** value for the model's performance evaluation.

**Note:** This project demonstrates the practical application of regression analysis to predict continuous variables (such as tip amounts) using Excel.
